/**
 * Identifies a type as being an actuator endpoint that provides information about the
 * running application. Endpoints can be exposed over a variety of technologies including
 * JMX and HTTP.
 * <p>
 * Most {@code @Endpoint} classes will declare one or more
 * {@link ReadOperation @ReadOperation}, {@link WriteOperation @WriteOperation},
 * {@link DeleteOperation @DeleteOperation} annotated methods which will be automatically
 * adapted to the exposing technology (JMX, Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux, Jersey etc.).
 * <p>
 * {@code @Endpoint} represents the lowest common denominator for endpoints and
 * intentionally limits the sorts of operation methods that may be defined in order to
 * support the broadest possible range of exposure technologies. If you need deeper
 * support for a specific technology you can either write an endpoint that is
 * {@link FilteredEndpoint filtered} to a certain technology, or provide
 * {@link EndpointExtension extension} for the broader endpoint.
